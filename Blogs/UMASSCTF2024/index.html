        <div class="blog-panel">
            UMass CTF is always a fun (and also quite stressful) time of the year here at UMass. I've been a challenge
            author for the past two years and would say I have a bit of author experience now. With that said, I only
            contributed to two challs this year <a href="#future_router">Future Router</a> and <a
                href="#cash_cache">Cash Cache</a>.
        </div>
        <h1 id="future_router">
            Future Router
        </h1>
        <div class="blog-panel">
            Future Router was the first challenge I wrote for the CTF, and it was the most solved one as
            well. By the end of the CTF it had <b>63 solves</b>.
        </div>
        <img src="future-points.png">
        <div class="blog-panel">
            This was a sourceless challenge, which many CTF players may scoff at but I thought it would be a cool idea
            to have a challenge where an attacker <i>leaks</i> the source. With this in mind, I tried to guide players
            with several hints, comments, and information in the challenge so that they could get a rewarding solve (and
            learn a lot too).
        </div>
        <img src="future-index.png" width="75%">
        <div class="blog-panel">
            The first thing players are greeted with is the welcome page with some text as well as a navbar. A player
            can click around the site and see the dashboard which shows which devices are on the network with the
            router, a cURL page to test cURL'ing webpages, as well as a customer service agent that claims it is out of
            service and tells us to try other other features. Most experienced web players will be initially drawn
            towards
            the <code>cURL</code> endpoint, however my intent is that new players will be guided there by response of
            the customer service agent.
        </div>
        <img src="future-curl.png" width="75%">
        <div class="blog-panel">
            So seeing the <code>cURL</code> most players would try to send a request to a remote site, for our case
            let's choose <code>umasscybersec.org</code>. However, it does not work because the server cannot make
            outbound connections. Players may not know this completely yet, but there is a message above hinting towards
            it that reads <code>currently, you can only cURL the devices in the network </code>. At this point, players
            might be reminded that the dashboard claims that there are "devices" on the network, all of which are open
            one port 80. So let's <code>cURL</code> on of those. Let's say <code>patricks-rock</code>.
        </div>
        <img src="future-patrick.png" width="75%">
        <div class="blog-panel">
            We get HTML text in the response, but I put a comment here to try and prevent players from going down a
            rabbithole: <code> &lt;!-- This is a static web server, don't waste too much time here! --&gt;</code>.
            Essentially these sites existed as other docker containers in the network statically hosted HTML files. I
            put them in, not to confuse players, but to show that there are devices in the network that the router can
            reach even though the internet is not available. With this I expected players to research what types of SSRF
            attacks you can do on <code>cURL</code>. More specifically, I wanted players to find that they can try
            different <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                href="https://curl.se/docs/url-syntax.html#scheme">URL schemes</a> on <code>cURL</code>. Most players
            found that you can perform an LFI by reaching out to <code>file:///etc/passwd</code>.
        </div>
        <img src="future-lfi.png" width="75%">
        <div class="blog-panel">
            My hope here is that most players would want to get the source code of the web app (I know I would!). Well,
            if we can read arbitrary files, then source would likely be readable as well. Since the server would be the
            current process running players would have to look in <code>/proc/self</code> to find useful files to leak
            more about the server process. First, players would need to find what command was running the server. For
            this we can run <code>file:///proc/self/cmdline</code>. This lets us see the command is running
            <code>gunicorn</code> with <code>app:app</code>. Hopefully at this point, players would look at the <a
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                href="https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/run.html#gunicorn">gunicorn documentation</a> and find that
            the first <code>app</code> would refer to the module the app was running, in our case <code>app.py</code>.
        </div>
        <img src="future-cmdline.png" width="75%">
        <div class="blog-panel">
            Since players would now know the source file, they would have to figure out how to leak it by referencing
            its path through the LFI. The intended solution was for users to read <code>/proc/self/cwd/app.py</code> as
            <code>cwd</code> would point to the current working directory AKA where the command was ran from. However,
            when we ported to infra we reintroduced several unintended solutions that were patched locally such as
            reading <code>/proc/self/environ</code> to read the working directory or leaking all the working directories
            with the entrypoint found in <code>/proc/1/cmdline</code>. It's kind of unfortunate that these were
            introduced, however I did have access to testing this challenge remotely before the competition. I just did
            not remember to re-check for them again when testing it on remote. It brings up a good point for next year,
            the solve/healthcheck script provided by authors should also check for unintended solutions in the
            challenges. Then, make sure that this author check must pass before the challenge can be merged into the
            main branch of the repo. Enough of that however, at this point the player should finally get their first
            taste of code.

            Well, looks like Plankton was planning on exfiltrating the secret krabby patty formula by echo'ing into a
            file. Unfortunately, he hasn't figured out how to mitigate command injections yet so he just has a simple
            regex. The comment at the top of the source code here is another hint for players that the container will
            have no outbound internet access, so they will have to exfiltrate commands some other way. Most players who
            got this far figured they could do some bash interpolation to run expressions inside the command. So as long
            as they xor'd their input they could run <code>krabby patty $([cmd-here])</code>. My intended solution had
            players run a command and write its output to a file like so:
            <code>krabby patty $(ls / > /tmp/outfile)</code>. Players could then read this file with the LFI and see
            that the flag was in the root directory.

        <h4> Final Thoughts on Future Router</h4>

        <div class="blog-panel">
            All in all, I hope this challenge was fun and rewarding for players even though there was no source. I
            wanted to make a chall with some vulnerabilities I haven't seen in other CTF's so the source code leak was
            the way I went. If you're interested in trying out the chall in its intended configuration, I've uploaded
            the code <a href="https://github.com/Jaquiez/my-ctf-challenges/tree/main/UMASS-CTF-2024/future_router">here</a>.
        </div>

        <h1 id="cash_cache"> Cash Cache</h1>

        <div class="blog-panel">
            The second, and final, challenge I made was Cash Cache. For this challenge I wrote a buggy HTTP proxy that
            parsed requests incorrectly and allows users to perform HTTP request smuggling to the backend server. This
            implementation was very silly as you'll see throughout the challenge. The coverup for my bad coding ability
            was the theme of the challenge: Patrick wrote the cache for Mr. Krabs to make more money off customers who
            used the site. Theming aside, at the end of the CTF this challenge only had <strong>11 solves</strong>,
            making it the least solved web challenge. With that said let's rev up those fryers and check out the
            challenge.
        </div>
        <img src="cash-points.png">
        <div class="blog-panel">
            Before we dive into source, let's take a moment to admire the site... Ahhh, what a work of art. But despite
            my inability to frontend webdev properly, there is nothing wrong to see... yet.
        </div>
        <img src="cash-index.png" width="75%">
        <div class="blog-panel">
            The source is identical to what's running on infra because we ran this challenge separately from our main
            kCTF cluster. To make it easy, I gave users a docker-compose that built the entire challenge. In that
            docker-compose users would see a frontend, backend, and a redis cache. The frontend is our simple nginx
            proxy, the backend includes the cache and webserver, and the redis cache stores all the data from the cache.
            Here, I intended players to do some code review, specifically looking for interesting vectors. During the
            code review, I know most web players should be drawn to a certain part of the source.

            Yeah, don't load pickle data that you don't trust. If you control pickle data, you can easily leverage
            remote code execution on a system. We can do this by picklng a class with a malicious
            <code>__reduce__</code> function that will be called by pickle when it loads the object. However, there are
            plenty of blog posts about pickle vulnerabilities, for the sake of this challenge though we can assume that
            if we can control what gets passed into this call, then we can get RCE on the target. I got the idea of
            using <code>pickle</code> for serializing this cache data from real python implementations of caches.
            Specifically, the <strong>SerialFlow</strong> challenge from HackTheBox Cyber Apocalypse CTF 2024 introduced
            (and acquainted me more than I'd like) to a python memcached client that used pickle when setting or getting
            complex objects.

            Of course Patrick (I), left a way for users to somehow control the data. In this case, the data for the
            <code>pickle.loads</code> call is first fetched from the redis cache, however in <code>cash.py</code> there
            (should) be no way to set an arbitrary pickle object into the cache. However, there is an interesting
            <code>/debug</code> endpoint in the backend express server.

            So, if you hit the developer debug endpoint then you can set an element in the cache to your arbitrary
            data.At this point, I assumed most players realized they would need to send a request to the server as
            localhost to the <code>/debug</code> endpoint to then set a malicious pickle value in the cache, then send a
            request to trigger this payload to load. However, that is easier said than done (granted I did not leave any
            unintended solutions). I imagine that after a few naive attempts at sending requests with the
            <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> header set, users would realize they would have to perform a HTTP Request
            Smuggling attack to set their own header and hit the endpoint in their smuggled request.

            Now that I've tasked the player with the unfortunate task of reading my python code, they should find that
            the proxy has the ability to send multiple requests at once. Reading the source code below, there is a
            strange encoding that the site accepts called <code>Cash-Encoding</code> and it wants it in
            <strong>Money!</strong> mode.

            As we all know, Mr. Krabs is a very generous businessman and he has allowed users to send multiple HTTP
            requests ONLY if they spend ten million dollars. As you might notice, <code>Cash-Encoding</code> bears a
            resemblance to <code>Transfer-Encoding</code>. People should see that they need to perform a
            Content-Length.Cash-Encoding (CL.CE) attack, which should be very similar to <a target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"

            attacks. However, the number of characters you use is linked to dollars you spend, which is a float rather
            than an int. Mr. Krabs expected 10 million dollars. However, you can never actually spend the money in a
            single request because the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                href="https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-management-suite/acm/how-to/policies/request-body-size-limit/#policy-settings">default
                nginx policy for request body sizes</a> is limited to 1 megabyte. So we cannot simply send one big
            request. You can't send negative dollars due to some checks at the bottom of the loop. However, if we send
            <code>NaN DOLLARS</code> as our amount it will cause every single check that compares amount to become false
            due to how NaN works in python. Before, if you send a request with <code>Cash-Encoding</code>, the server
            would complain about it being badly formed. However, when you spend <code>NaN dollars</code> it passes and
            updates Cash Spent.

        <div class="blog-panel">
            At this point, if you try to naively smuggle a request then Mr. Krabs will yell at you for a badly formed
            request. Why? Because the body is buffered depending on how the index is set in the ternary above. However
            Patrick left an interesting note in the source code:
            <blockquote>
                I wrote this Ternary Operator today because I learned it in boating school. For some reason it sometimes
                cuts off the end of requests. But it probably is not a big deal.
            </blockquote>
            Well, part of the request gets cut off... And upon furthuer inspection it makes sense, specifcally the
            <code>index</code> should be set to <code>len(stream_text) - 1</code> if the amount is larger than the
            remaining length however it is set to <code>len(stream_text) - len(cur)</code>. In most cases this would be
            around ~15 characters however an attacker can be very clever here. We cannot simply add spaces to our
            request because the parser expects the value and units to be exactly one space apart. At this point, I
            wanted users to explore how <code>float</code> parses user strings. Many that solved the challenge found
            that if you include whitespace characters like "\r" or "\t" you could arbitrarily increase the size of the
            current line while still preserving how float interprets <code>NaN</code>. With this, users could make their
            current line exactly as long as their smuggled request to allow the parser to set the body of the first
            request to 0 and parse the next request normally.

            After you get this, it should not take too much more to write a weaponized exploit using a malicious

        <h4> Final Thoughts on Cash Cache</h4>
        <div class="blog-panel">
            This challenge was a lot, and definitely difficult. However, my main goal was to have people think about how
            request smuggling works at the protocol level, how to weaponize it with some clever tricks, then actively
            exploiting it via the serialization vector in the cache. I'm hoping people learned something and had fun
            with this challenge as I definitely had (mostly) fun writing it as well!
